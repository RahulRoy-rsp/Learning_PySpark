# PySpark DataFrames

## What is a DataFrame?

- A **DataFrame** in PySpark is a distributed collection of data, organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational database or a pandas DataFrame.
- It is a fundamental data structure in PySpark and provides powerful capabilities for data processing and analysis.

## Why Use DataFrames?

- **Ease of Use**: DataFrames provide an easy-to-use API for handling structured data.
- **Optimized Execution**: PySpark optimizes query execution using the Catalyst optimizer.
- **Support for Multiple Data Sources**: DataFrames can be created from JSON, CSV, Parquet, JDBC, and more.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle big data across distributed systems.
- **Interoperability**: Can be converted to/from RDDs and Pandas DataFrames.
